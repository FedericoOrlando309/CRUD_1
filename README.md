****1. Analysis****

****1.1 - Introduction to my solution****
  I’m creating a program where the user can enter a Username and Password and be able to add, edit and delete as much user’s information as needed. 

****1.2 - Computational Methods****
- Decomposition (breaking down a complex problem into smaller parts that are more manageable)
  I use Decomposition to fix the problem of  understanding the task at hand. By viewing and sketching out what I need to accomplish in more digestible bites; I am able to use Decomposition to help me in not only planning but programming.

- Abstraction(removing elements of a code or program that aren’t relevant)
  I used this heavily to stick to the task at hand. At once I wanted to make it so the program appeared in the centre of the screen. While I still want to achieve this. I realise that I could achieve this after the program actually started working.

- Pattern recognition(similar patterns, themes)
  This helped a lot, especially when making the buttons for the Welcome page and even the Login and Sign Up validation for the Login page as they use similar algorithms.

- Thinking logically and ahead 
  I used this by pre determining what the user might do by testing the program regularly. An example would be pre determining the user would maybe leave something blank in the entry box- if they did it would display an error message. 

****Login Page****
DESCRIPTION - Allows the user to enter a Username and Password in the entry boxes. If they press Singup it would save the user’s Username and Password into the Database. If they press Login, it would check if their Username and Password are present in the Database and allow the user to move to the next window.
JUSTIFICATION - By allowing the User to Login and save their Username and Password, it allows the Program to be accessed by the same people later on.
              - By allowing the User to Sign Up it makes it so the User can save their Username and Password to the Database which allows them to Login later on. 

****Welcome Page****
DESCTIPTION - Has a banner welcoming the user. It allows the user to scroll and see every user’s information that has been entered and is in the Database. 
            - If they press ADD it would move the user to the Details window and allow the user to input their details. 
            - If they press the DELETE button they would delete a selected user’s information.
            - If they press EDIT it would allow the user to edit the selected user’s information.
            - If they press REFRESH  it would essentially reset the data that is shown on the window.  
JUSTIFICATION - It personalises the Window to be more for the User that has logged in.
            - The ADD button allows the user to input their details and save it to the Database
            - The DELETE button allows them to delete the user’s information from the Database.
            - The EDIT button allows the user to EDIT pre existing data that is in the Database. 
            - The REFRESH button simply makes it so the information on the window is up to date with what is in the Database.

****Details****
DESCRIPTION - Allows the user to enter their details and then submit them which saves it to the Database.
JUSTIFICATION - Allows the user to input their data and save it to the Database.
